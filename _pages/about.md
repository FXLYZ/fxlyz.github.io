<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Nankai University (NKU). I received my Master degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), advised by [**Prof. Xiaochun Cao**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDgp6OkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Currently, I am looking for applying the Ph.D. candidate of Autumn 2024. Feel free to connect if there are suitable opportunities!

My future research will be dedicated to applying **AI for Medicine (AIM)**, with a particular focus on the applications of **Multi-modal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs)** in healthcare.
