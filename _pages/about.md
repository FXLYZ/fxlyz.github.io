<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Nankai University (NKU). I received my Master degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), advised by [**Prof. Xiaochun Cao**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDgp6OkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Currently, I am looking for applying the Ph.D. candidate of Autumn 2024. Feel free to connect if there are suitable opportunities!

My future research will be dedicated to applying **AI for biology** and **AI for medical**, with a particular focus on the applications of **large language models (LLMs)** in other domains. In addition, I am also interested in Large Language Model Guided Interaction, Learning, and Planing for **Robotic Agent**.
