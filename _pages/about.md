I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Nankai University (NKU), China. I am a M.S. student supervised with **Prof. Xiaochun Cao**(https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDgp6OkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China. I am also an internship student superivsed with **Prof. Song-chun Zhu**(http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/) and **Dr. Zilong Zheng**(https://zilongzheng.github.io) in Beijing Institute of General Artificial Intelligence (BIAGI), China. I will graduate in June 2024. Currently, I am looking for applying the Ph.D. candidate of Autumn 2024. Feel free to connect if there are suitable opportunities!

My current research mainly fouces on **Embodied AI** including Large Language Model Guided Interaction, Learning, and Planing for Embodied AI, Real Scene Multi-modal Reasoning for Embodied AI. I am also interested in **Human-centric AI** including Huuman-Object Relationship Detection, Dynamic Human Action Understanding, Human Parsing.
